# 09-SQL-challenge

In this assignment, I designed tables to hold employee data imported into a SQL databases from CSV files. I then performed data analysis to answer questions about the data in the created database.

The project contains three major parts:

    1. Data Modeling
       - Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.
       
    2. Data Engineering
       - Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
       - Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
       
    3. Data Analysis
        - Once I had a complete database, I did the following:
            - List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
            - List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
            - List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
            - List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
            - List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
            - List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
            - List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
            - In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
